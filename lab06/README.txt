For this lab, we elaborated on the previous labs' code.  This week, we were able to get some of the navigations of the 
app done.  Now, there is a working home page and an edit-todo page that can be accesses from the home page.  This lab
was really useful for learning how to utilize the navigation in the app and how to style certain things (like the back 
button and clickable items).
